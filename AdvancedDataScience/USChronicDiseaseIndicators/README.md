## Introduction
The intentions of my analysis are rooted in better understanding confounding factors within public health by examining a publicly available U.S. government dataset on chronic disease indicators from 2001 to 2021. As my parents age and deal with their own personal health problems, I find myself more interested than ever to see what lifestyle adjustments they could potentially make in order to achieve the best possible health outcomes. In this way, this analysis includes a rather personal component, giving me added curiosity and incentive to discover insight.

Among these 124 chronic indicators are a variety of interesting "questions"; in my examination of these indicators, I aimed to draw upon my pre-existing health knowledge to see if I could find interesting associations between different indicators. My goal in this data exploration is to uncover statistical validation for some of my correlation hypotheses. In the below Visualizations section, we will examine R^2 values to determine how well one variable predicts another. As you will see, I am able to demonstrate some relevant correlations through my statistical analysis. Nevertheless, given the multitudinous variables involved in health outcomes, it is very difficult to demonstrate direct correlations between two distinct health indicators.

## Data Summary
The Division of Population Health within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides this publicly available dataset of U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators, with data ranging from 2001 to 2021. Within this "cross-cutting set" are 124 disease indicators, which allow for uniformity across different states, territories, and metropolitan areas in terms of specific definitions and collection/reporting processes. The CDC falls under the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

This dataset contains over 1,000,000?????? entries, making it beyond the capabilities of using Excel to analyze it given its grid limitations. Therefore, using R was the logical approach. In terms of wrangling/cleaning the data, I was fortunate that the dataset well-maintained. Given this, the only step associated with data wrangling that was necessary was using functions within R to ignore cells with NA (empty) values.

Additionally, I made the decision to remove outliers below the 1st percentile and above the 99th percentile for heart failure mortality and liver disease mortality. These outliers highly skewed the data and prevented me from telling the most insightful story.

A visual examination of the dataset does show some columns lacking consistency in the thoroughness of their content; however, these were irrelevant for the purposes of my analysis given that I focused on mainly three columns of data: the Question column (represeting one of the 124 disease indicators), the DataValue column (representing the corresponding data value for its associated Question, and the State column.

<img src="https://myerberg.github.io/AdvancedDataScience/USChronicDiseaseIndicators/assets/images/obesity_cholesterol_correlation_with_fit.png" width="1000" />
<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">This graph displays a statistically significant relationship between obesity and high cholesterol prevalence among U.S. adults from 2001 to 2021. Despite the significance (p < 0.001), the low R-value (0.09) and R^2 (0.009) suggest that obesity alone poorly predicts cholesterol levels, indicating other factors may play substantial roles in cholesterol variability.</h4>

<img src="https://myerberg.github.io/AdvancedDataScience/USChronicDiseaseIndicators/assets/images/heart_failure_mortality_vs_alcohol_consumption.png" width="1000" />
<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">This graph reveals a statistically significant yet weak inverse relationship between U.S. adult alcohol consumption and heart failure mortality from 2001 to 2021. Despite the low R of 0.093 and R^2 of 0.009, indicating minimal variance explained, the model's p-value suggests the relationship is unlikely due to random chance.</h4>

<img src="https://myerberg.github.io/AdvancedDataScience/USChronicDiseaseIndicators/assets/images/liver_disease_mortality_vs_alcohol_consumption.png" width="1000" />
<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">The graph depicts a linear regression analysis of U.S. adult alcohol consumption against liver disease mortality, highlighting a statistically significant but weak negative correlation (R = 0.099, R^2 = 0.010, p-value < 0.001). The low R^2 value suggests that alcohol consumption alone does not strongly predict liver disease mortality rates.</h4>

<div class="centered-content" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://myerberg.github.io/AdvancedDataScience/USChronicDiseaseIndicators/assets/images/heart_failure_mortality_poly_vs_alcohol_consumption.png" width="1000" />
<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">The polynomial regression yields a slightly improved but still weak correlation (R = 0.102, R^2 = 0.009) between alcohol consumption and heart failure mortality. A p-value of 0.000 suggests a relationship, yet the minimal increase in R and R^2 offers scant practical predictive improvement over the linear model.</h4>

<img src="https://myerberg.github.io/AdvancedDataScience/USChronicDiseaseIndicators/assets/images/liver_disease_mortality_poly_vs_alcohol_consumption.png" width="1000" />
<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">The polynomial regression slightly refines the correlation between alcohol consumption and liver disease mortality (R = 0.102, R^2 = 0.011, p-value < 0.001), but like the linear model, it demonstrates that alcohol consumption alone does not robustly predict mortality outcomes.</h4>

<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">The graph shows a linear relationship between alcohol use and smokeless tobacco use among U.S. youth, with a very low R of 0.066 and an R^2 of 0.004, indicating a weak predictive power. The significant p-value (p < 0.001) suggests a relationship, although it accounts for a very small fraction of the variation in smokeless tobacco use.</h4>

<h4 style="color:#B5E853; margin: 0.5em 0 0;">The chart illustrates a linear model between alcohol use and cigarette smoking among U.S. youth, revealing a weak positive correlation (R = 0.098, RÂ² = 0.010) with a statistically significant p-value (p < 0.001). The model suggests a relationship exists, though it explains only a small portion of the variance in youth smoking behavior.</h4>

## Conclusion
As we have seen, it is clear that various indicators show interesting positive correlations. Nevertheless, we cannot make direct conclusions about health outcomes using only two indicators, even after exploring polynomial fits. In healthcare, it is best to take a holistic approach to improve outcomes, given that the affect of one indicator on overall health is compounded across the wide-range of linked biological pathways.

My conclusion for this data exploration is that certain lifestyle choices and government policies can effect individual health outcomes, but it can be difficult to make any sort of definite conclusion about what one indicator will reveal in terms of population-wide health. For example, higher alcohol consumption may be linked to higher incidence of liver disease, but this is certainly not a guarantee.

My hope for this project is that anyone who examines its statistical analyses keeps in mind their unique context, as well as remembering that this dataset, despite being vast, certainly is limited by the fact that it does not consistently capture every state/territory/metropolitan area for every unique indicator. Ultimately, my main takeaway from this project is the wisdom that we can impact our health with our own choices, and I hope to be able to use this sharpened understanding in my own life, for both myself and for the people I care most about.
